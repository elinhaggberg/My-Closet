// photos are being moved automatically, and offers an optional backup
// download first for extra peace of mind. Purely informational with respect
// to the migration itself: dismissing it any way doesn't block or delay
// that, which runs regardless (see app.js) and is what naturally stops this
// from showing again once there's nothing left to migrate.
//
// Returns a promise that resolves once the sheet is gone (however it was
// dismissed), so a caller can hold off on stacking another one-time sheet
// (e.g. What's New) right on top of this one before it's even been read.
