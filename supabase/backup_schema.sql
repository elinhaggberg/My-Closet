-- One row per saved card, keyed by the app's own client-side id so every
-- device agrees on the same identity for the same record -- that's what
-- lets two devices converge on one shared dataset instead of just
-- duplicating each other's data. "data" holds the full record as JSON,
-- same shape as what's already in localStorage. "deleted" is a tombstone
-- rather than an actual row delete, so a device that's been offline for a
-- while can still learn something was removed elsewhere instead of just
-- never hearing about it.

-- No policies are defined on purpose -- the anon/publishable key can never
-- read or write this table directly, even if the key or project URL leaks.
-- All access goes through the backup-sync Edge Function, which uses the
-- service role key server-side only, and requires the backup passphrase (a
-- plain Edge Function secret, BACKUP_PASSPHRASE -- see backup-sync/index.ts)
-- on every request. That passphrase is the actual thing protecting real
-- content here.

-- Private Storage bucket for Cloud Backup's image sync (see
-- js/cloudImageSync.js) -- holds the actual bytes of uploaded photos, keyed
-- by "<store>/<recordId>", so a synced record only ever carries a small
-- "storage:<store>:<recordId>" reference instead of its image's full data:
-- URI. No RLS policy is defined here either, same reasoning as
-- backup_records above -- only the backup-image Edge Function's
-- service-role client can ever reach this bucket, gated by the same backup
-- passphrase as every other Cloud Backup call.
